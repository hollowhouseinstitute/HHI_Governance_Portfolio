    <h2>Structured Human Intelligence</h2>

    <p>
      The Hollow House Institute (HHI) is an AI governance and compliance organization
      operating on a governance-first doctrine.
    </p>

    <p>
      Our work focuses on <strong>longitudinal behavioral governance</strong>,
      treating behavior over time as infrastructure rather than data points.
    </p>

    <h3>Core Principles</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Governance before agents</li>
      <li>Definitions precede systems</li>
      <li>Behavior is the most honest data there is</li>
      <li>Time turns behavior into infrastructure</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      This portfolio is a governed proof surface demonstrating how AI governance
      functions when language, behavior, and authority are treated as infrastructure.
