# Audit Alignment — Governance & Language

This portfolio demonstrates alignment between HHI_GOV_01 and HHI_LUL_01.

HHI_GOV_01 defines enforceable behavioral governance requirements for AI systems operating over time.
HHI_LUL_01 governs the commercial use of Hollow House Institute canonical governance terminology.

These instruments are complementary and non-overlapping:
- Governance controls system behavior.
- Licensing controls language claims.

Together they prevent governance drift and semantic misuse.
