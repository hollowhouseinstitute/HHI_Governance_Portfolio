# Public Audit Summary

This system references Hollow House Institute governance artifacts.

Behavioral governance is defined by HHI_GOV_01, a public, governance-locked standard.
Language use is governed by HHI_LUL_01, a licensing instrument controlling commercial use of canonical terms.

This separation ensures governance claims are both operationally constrained and linguistically accountable.
