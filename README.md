# Hollow House Institute — Governance Portfolio

**Structured Human Intelligence**  
*Time turns behavior into infrastructure.*

This repository is the **public portfolio and proof surface** for the Hollow House Institute (HHI), an AI compliance and governance organization operating on a **governance-before-agents** doctrine.

---

## What This Is

A governance-first AI portfolio demonstrating:

- **Longitudinal Behavioral Governance**
- **Canonical Language Authority**
- **Audit-ready AI compliance infrastructure**
- **Governance before agents**
- **Behavior as the most honest data there is**

This repository exists to show *how governance is operationalized*, not merely described.

---

## Governance Architecture

This portfolio is downstream of three canonical authorities:

1. **Hollow House Standards Library**  
   *Upstream definitions and terminology authority*

2. **HHI_GOV_01**  
   *Longitudinal Behavioral Governance Standard*

3. **HHI Master License Suite**  
   *Language use, governance enforcement, and audit constraints*

All terminology used here is governed by the **Hollow House Governance Glossary**.  
If language drifts, governance fails.

---

## What This Portfolio Demonstrates

- How **behavioral patterns become governance infrastructure over time**
- Why **definitions precede systems**
- How AI systems can be evaluated longitudinally rather than episodically
- How governance can exist *before* autonomous agents or automation layers

This is not a demo app.  
It is a **governed proof surface**.

## AI Tooling Disclosure

Google Gemini was used for:
- Structured reasoning support
- Documentation synthesis
- Governance consistency checks

All outputs are human-governed and audit-defensible.
